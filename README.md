Flutter project to study concepts of riverpod & state-notifier

### Concept to Grab

This app is meant to study the concepts of riverpod & state-notifier

**Gist**

> RiverPod  

    It is used to provide classes down the widget tree
    under given ProviderScope

    classes used
    - ProviderScope()
    - Provider<T>()
    - Consumer()
    - ProviderListener<T>(), etc...

> StateNotifier (Immutable State Management )

    It is one of the State Management Solution.
    unlike ValueNotifier, It does not allows to modify state from outside

    It is integrated to use with riverpod efficiently

    classes to keep in focus :
    - StateNotifierProvider<T>()
